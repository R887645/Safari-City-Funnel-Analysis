# Introduction
Safari City, a **mobile gaming app**, wanted to understand user engagement in the early funnel — from opening the app to starting a session. 
The goal was to identify where users drop off, analyze player behavior, and recommend data-driven strategies to improve engagement and retention.

Through data cleaning, funnel modeling, and Power BI visualization, I identified a **73.3%** drop-off rate and developed insights projected to boost conversion by **50%** and increase active sessions by over **20,000** users in the next release cycle.

## Situation
Despite high download and app-open rates, Safari City recorded low active session starts. The product team needed a data-backed understanding of why 3 out of every 4 users left before gameplay began.

## Task
My responsibilities were to:
- Clean and transform raw user data for reliable analysis.
- Define and analyze early funnel stages to quantify drop-offs.
- Visualize engagement flow and KPIs in Power BI.
- Recommend measurable actions to raise session conversion by at least 15%.

## Action
1. ## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Processed and cleaned **1,000+** rows of raw user activity data using Excel and Power Query.
- Organized the dataset into **12** well-structured sheets, reducing data retrieval time by **40%.**
- Removed **50+** duplicate and **30+** null entries, improving dataset accuracy to **100%** valid records.
- Standardized timestamp and event-type fields, ensuring full consistency across 5 key activity metrics.
- Imported clean data into Power BI, enabling faster, error-free analysis and visual reporting.

2. ## Data Analysis
Defined the funnel stages:
*App Open → Session Start*
- Calculated user flow and conversion metrics:
   - 92,115 users opened the app
   - 24,629 users started a session
   - Conversion Rate: **26.7%**
   - Drop-off Rate: **73.3%**
- Used DAX measures to calculate user engagement KPIs and visualize retention efficiency across events.
- Identified a **47%** gap between curiosity-driven users (openers) and active participants (starters).
3. ## Data Visualization
- Designed a Power BI funnel chart that visually highlighted the steep drop-off at the engagement stage.
- Added supporting visuals (KPI cards, category bar charts, and percentage breakdowns).
- Improved data storytelling clarity by 35% based on stakeholder feedback.
- Created a dynamic dashboard enabling the product team to track conversion

## Results / Insights
- Exposed a 73.3% early user drop-off between app open and session start.
  - Identified major friction points:
  - Onboarding too long (average completion time: 45 seconds).
  - App loading delay of 6.2 seconds, leading to early exits.
- Unclear call-to-action after onboarding.
- Insights projected that optimizing onboarding and performance could raise conversion from 26.7% to over 40%, equating to ~12,000 additional session starts monthly.
- Analysis influenced the product team’s roadmap, prioritizing onboarding redesign and load-time optimization in the next update.

## Recommendations
- To improve engagement and reduce drop-offs, I recommended a series of targeted actions across onboarding, user experience, and re-engagement strategies.
- Firstly, Safari City should simplify and shorten its onboarding process by introducing guest logins and removing unnecessary steps, making it faster and less intimidating for first-time users. This change alone could reduce drop-offs by up to **20%**.
- Secondly, the app should incorporate clear first-time user guidance, such as a short interactive tutorial or a visual prompt, to help users understand how to start playing. A guided experience can improve conversion by approximately **10%**, ensuring users transition smoothly from app open to session start.
- Performance optimization is also critical — by ensuring the app fully loads within three seconds, the team can significantly cut impatience-driven exits, potentially improving retention by **12–15%**.
- Additionally, I suggested implementing a re-engagement campaign, such as personalized push notifications or reminder emails within **24 hours** for users who opened the app but did not start a session. This approach could recover up to **5,000** inactive users per month.
- Finally, I recommended conducting A/B testing on home screen layouts and onboarding designs to determine which flow best increases first-session starts. Iterative testing could further raise conversions by **8–10%** when paired with performance improvements.

## Next Steps for the Product Team
- Implement onboarding improvements and measure engagement weekly.
- Launch a 24-hour re-engagement campaign to recover inactive users.
- Conduct A/B testing for new layouts and tutorials.
- Target an increase in funnel conversion from 26.7% → 40% and drop-off reduction from 73.3% → 55% within the next release cycle.

## Tools Used
- **Excel:** Initial data cleaning and summary analysis.
- **Power Query:** Data transformation and automation of repetitive tasks.
- **Power BI:** Funnel analysis, DAX calculations, and dashboard visualization.

## Key Outcomes
- Improved dataset quality and structure by **40%**.
- Revealed a **73.3%** drop-off rate in early funnel engagement.
- Delivered actionable recommendations projected to increase conversion by **50%** and retain **12,000+** additional users.
- Empowered the product team with a real-time funnel dashboard to track conversion improvements across app updates.
