# Safari-City-Funnel-Analysis
This project was conducted as part of my assessment for the Data Analyst role at Maliyo Games. It involves analyzing early-funnel data for Safari City to visualize player behavior and identify key drop-off or engagement points. Insights from the analysis will inform recommendations for improving player retention, progression, and monetization strategies.
